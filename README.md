## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tejas615/ZCoder.git
    cd ZCoder
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install          # installs root dependencies
    cd server && npm install
    cd ../client && npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file inside `/server`:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    PORT=5000  # or your preferred port
    ```

4. **Run the application**

    Open two terminal sessions:

    **Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start        # or node server.js
    ```

    **Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

    The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default, and the React app runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
